# InvertedIndexSearchEngine
This library provides efficient implementations of tree data structures such as
Binary Search tree, AVL tree, TST tree, Balanced TST tree and Trie in addition
to Hash table and other data structures only using array and array List.
Additionally, we leveraged these data structures to index a dictionary passages
and allow users to search, list and manipulate the data structures using a CUI
interface.
